# Quality Assessment Thresholds Configuration
# This file documents the heuristics and thresholds used by doc-manager's quality assessment

# Overall Score Calculation
# ========================
# The overall score is calculated by averaging individual criterion scores
# and applying these thresholds:
overall_score_thresholds:
  excellent: 3.5  # Average score >= 3.5
  good: 2.5       # Average score >= 2.5
  fair: 1.5       # Average score >= 1.5
  poor: 0.0       # Average score < 1.5

# Score Value Mappings
# ====================
# Each criterion returns one of these scores, mapped to numeric values:
score_values:
  excellent: 4
  good: 3
  fair: 2
  poor: 1

# Documentation Coverage Thresholds
# =================================
# Coverage percentage is mapped to a score using these thresholds:
coverage_thresholds:
  excellent: 75    # >= 75% coverage
  good: 50         # >= 50% coverage
  fair: 30         # >= 30% coverage
  poor: 0          # < 30% coverage

# Individual Criterion Thresholds
# ================================

# 1. RELEVANCE
# Assesses if documentation addresses current user needs
relevance:
  deprecated_references:
    warning_threshold: 5   # Show warning if > 5 deprecated references
    fair_threshold: 10     # Score becomes "fair" if > 10 deprecated references
  migration_doc_weight: 0.1  # Weight for deprecation mentions in migration docs
  required_files:
    - README.md  # Warns if not present

# 2. ACCURACY
# Assesses if documentation reflects actual codebase state
accuracy:
  broken_links:
    warning_threshold: 3   # Show warning if > 3 broken links
    fair_threshold: 10     # Score becomes "fair" if > 10 broken links
  missing_assets:
    warning_threshold: 2   # Show warning if > 2 missing assets
    fair_threshold: 5      # Score becomes "fair" if > 5 missing assets
  outdated_content:
    stale_days: 180        # Content is "stale" if not updated in 180 days
    warning_threshold: 5   # Warn if > 5 files are stale

# 3. PURPOSEFULNESS
# Assesses if documentation has clear goals and target audience
purposefulness:
  missing_description_threshold: 30  # Warn if > 30% of files lack descriptions
  placeholder_content:
    patterns:
      - "TODO"
      - "FIXME"
      - "TBD"
      - "Coming soon"
    warning_threshold: 3  # Warn if > 3 placeholders found

# 4. UNIQUENESS
# Assesses for redundant or conflicting information
uniqueness:
  content_similarity:
    high_similarity_threshold: 0.8  # > 80% similar = likely duplicate
    warning_threshold: 3            # Warn if > 3 highly similar file pairs
  conflicting_information:
    warning_threshold: 2  # Warn if > 2 conflicts detected

# 5. CONSISTENCY
# Assesses alignment of terminology, formatting, and style
consistency:
  heading_case:
    inconsistency_threshold: 0.3  # > 30% inconsistent = warning
  list_formatting:
    inconsistency_threshold: 0.3  # > 30% inconsistent = warning
  terminology:
    variant_threshold: 3  # > 3 variants of same term = warning

# 6. CLARITY
# Assesses precision of language and navigation
clarity:
  readability:
    flesch_reading_ease:
      excellent: 60  # Flesch score >= 60 (plain English)
      good: 50
      fair: 40
      poor: 0
  navigation:
    max_depth: 4           # Warn if > 4 levels deep
    orphaned_docs_threshold: 2  # Warn if > 2 orphaned docs

# 7. STRUCTURE
# Assesses logical organization and appropriate depth
structure:
  heading_depth:
    max_recommended: 4     # H1-H4 recommended, H5-H6 discouraged
    warning_threshold: 3   # Warn if > 3 files exceed max depth
  file_organization:
    max_files_per_dir: 15  # Warn if > 15 files in one directory
    min_sections: 2        # Warn if file has < 2 sections (H2+)

# Quality Criteria Weights
# ========================
# All criteria have equal weight (1.0) in overall score calculation
# This can be customized in future versions for project-specific needs
criterion_weights:
  relevance: 1.0
  accuracy: 1.0
  purposefulness: 1.0
  uniqueness: 1.0
  consistency: 1.0
  clarity: 1.0
  structure: 1.0

# Notes:
# ------
# - All thresholds are currently hardcoded in the implementation
# - This file serves as documentation of current behavior
# - Future versions may support loading custom thresholds from this file
# - Thresholds were calibrated based on common documentation patterns
# - Adjust thresholds based on your project's specific needs
